### Testing & Deployment
- **Local**: Save as `index.html`, open in browser (Chrome), check F12 console for logs.
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to `main`, enable Pages (Settings → Pages → main branch, /root). Visit URL after 2-5 min.
- **Sep 29**: Select "2025-09-29" to see fixtures like Aston Villa vs Wolves.
- **Search**: Type "Burnley" to filter.
- **Standings**: Sort by "Pts" or "Home Win %".

If still blank, share console errors. For Sofascore integration, I can add it once display is stable. Let me know!
